Hiberlink Zotero Plugin
=======================

Introduction
------------

This is a plugin for the Zotero personal research assistant that allows the user to proactively archive their references without interrupting their usual workflow. The archival service can be chosen in the Hiberlink settings menu as well as whether HiberActive is used and which order the original and archive URLs are displayed. The archived references can be displayed in a table and this information can be exported as an HTML file with the links properly formatted.
